# Literally Just Survival

## ⚠️ DEPRECATED ⚠️  
This project is very old and never got much testing.  
Do not rely on it working perfectly.  
  
LJS is a simple plugin for Minecraft Spigot servers  
designed to allow your players to to teleport back  
and forth to a plain survival server with ease.  
  
Upon initial startup, your server will generate a  
new blank world called LJSurvival.  To access this  
world, type /ljs join in-game.  You will be  
teleported to this new world, and able to play. If  
you type /ljs leave, you will leave the world and  
return to where you were before, with everything  
you had before.  

If you leave the game while in LJS, you will join  
back in LJS "mode."  
  
Though I've tried to prevent some teleporting into  
and out of world issues, I am very inexperienced  
with actual Java programming and the Spigot API.
